 * 
 * Application Base Class - Framework for dual-core FreeRTOS applications
 * 
 * The App class provides a structured framework for building dual-core applications
 * on the RP2350 platform with FreeRTOS. It handles:
 * - Safety system initialization and integration
 * - Memory management system setup
 * - Dual-core initialization and coordination
 * - Watchdog system configuration
 * - FreeRTOS scheduler startup
 * 
 * Applications should inherit from this class and implement the required pure
 * virtual methods to define core-specific initialization and execution behavior.
 * 
 * The App class implements a global singleton pattern to facilitate Core 1
 * initialization. When an App instance is constructed, it registers itself
 * as the global instance. This allows the static Core 1 entry point trampoline
 * to access the instance methods needed for Core 1 startup.
 * 
 * Only one App instance should exist in the application. Creating multiple
 * instances will cause the global pointer to reference only the most recently
 * constructed instance.

     * @brief Base class for dual-core FreeRTOS applications on RP2350
     * 
     * The App class provides a complete framework for initializing and running
     * dual-core applications with integrated safety and memory management systems.
     * It inherits from SafeableComponent to participate in the safety monitoring
     * system.
     * 
     * Initialization sequence:
     * 1. Safety system initialization on Core 0
     * 2. Memory management system initialization
     * 3. Application-specific initialization via _init()
     * 4. Core 1 launch and initialization via _startCore1()
     * 5. Dual-core watchdog system setup
     * 6. Core 0 initialization via _initCore0()
     * 7. FreeRTOS scheduler start
     * 
     * Derived classes must implement:
     * - _initCore0(): Core 0 specific initialization (create tasks, etc.)
     * - _startCore1(): Core 1 initialization and execution
     * 
     * Derived classes may optionally override:
     * - _init(): Early initialization before core launch
