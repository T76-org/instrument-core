 * @brief Abstract USB interface class.
 * @copyright Copyright (c) 2025 MTA, Inc.
 * 
 * This file defines the abstract USB interface class that provides methods for
 * initializing the USB interface, sending data, and handling control transfers.
 * 
 * The class provides three interfaces:
 * 
 * - A CDC inteface for serial communication. This is co-opted by stdio so
 *   that printf and other stdio functions can be dumped directly to USB.
 * - An interface that's compatible with picotool's reset mechanism.
 *   This allows you to reset the device and enter bootloader mode,
 *   _provided_ that you set the USB properties correctly at compile time.
 * - A vendor interface that supports WebUSB and Microsoft OS 2.0 descriptors.
 *   This allows you to provide a custom landing page for your device
 *   when working with a compatible browser, as well as providing additional
 *   functionality, such as USBTMC compatibility.
 * - A USBTMC interface that provides a standard interface for test and 
 *   measurement devices.
 * 
 * The class is multithreaded and fully reentrant, allowing you to
 * send and receive data from multiple threads without blocking. It uses
 * a FreeRTOS queue to manage receiving and sending bulk data over the
 * vendor interface, and provides an internal task that manages 
 * TinyUSB events.
 * 
 * The class is designed to be used as a singleton, and you should
 * call the `init()` method to initialize it before using it.
 *
 * You must subclass this class and implement the following methods:
 * 
 * - `_onDataReceived`: This method is called when bulk data is received from 
 *   the USB interface.
 * - `_onVendorControlTransferIn`: called when a control transfer that expects data
 *   to be sent back to the host (`IN` direction from the host's perspective)
 *   is received. You must reply with the data to be sent back by calling
 *   `_sendVendorControlTransferData()` before returning. Note that the data
 *   sent back will be truncated to ITF_BUFFER_SIZE bytes, so you must
 *   ensure that the data you send back is no larger than that. If you 
 *   need to send more data, you should use bulk transfers instead.
 * - `_onVendorControlTransferOut`: called when a control transfer that expects data
 *   to be sent to the host (`OUT` direction from the host's perspective) is
 *   received. The data is passed as a vector of bytes, and you can process it
 *   as needed.
 * - `_onVendorDataReceived`: called when bulk data is received from the vendor 
 *   interface.
 * - `_onUSBTMCDataReceived`: called when bulk data is received from the USBTMC 
 *   interface. Remember that USBTMC transfers can be fragmented, so you may need to
 *   accumulate data until the transfer is complete. The speed USBTMC replies
 *   can be processed asynchronously, but you must be cognizant of the fact that
 *   USBTMC generally requires a specific response format and timing. Also,
 *   the class doesn't provide any mechanism for ensuring that a request is
 *   completely processed before the next request is handled, so you must
 *   ensure that your implementation can handle this.
 *
 * You can also change the USBTMC capabilities by initializing the
 * `_usbtmcStoredCapabilities` member in your subclass constructor.
 *
 * Control transfer methods must return `true` if the transfer was
 * successfully handled, or `false` if it was not. If you return `false`, the
 * TinyUSB stack will handle the transfer as an error and stall the endpoint.
 * 
 * USB vendor and product information can be set using the following
 * macros in your `CMakeLists.txt` file:
 * 
 * - T76_IC_USB_VENDOR_ID: The vendor ID for the USB device. This should be a unique identifier
 *   assigned to your organization by the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF).
 * - T76_IC_USB_PRODUCT_ID: The product ID for the USB device. This should be a unique identifier
 *   assigned to your product by your organization.
 * - T76_IC_USB_MANUFACTURER_STRING: The manufacturer string for the USB device.
 * - T76_IC_USB_PRODUCT_STRING: The product string for the USB device.
 * - T76_IC_USB_URL: The URL for the USB device. This is typically a link to your product's
 *   documentation or support page.
 * 
 * You can further customize the USB interface by setting the following
 * macros in your `CMakeLists.txt` file:
 * 
 * - `T76_IC_USB_RUNTIME_TASK_PRIORITY`: The priority for the USB runtime task. This should be a
 *   value between 0 and configMAX_PRIORITIES - 1, where 0 is the highest priority.
 * - `T76_IC_USB_RUNTIME_TASK_STACK_SIZE`: The stack size for the USB runtime task. This should be
 *   a value in bytes, and should be large enough to handle the USB runtime task's
 *   requirements.
 * - `T76_IC_USB_DISPATCH_TASK_PRIORITY`: The priority for the USB dispatch task. Generally, this
 *   should be lower than the runtime task priority, but still high enough to handle
 *   dispatching USB events in a timely manner.
 * - `T76_IC_USB_DISPATCH_TASK_STACK_SIZE`: The stack size for the USB dispatch task. Like the
 *   runtime task stack size, this should be large enough to handle the dispatch task's
 *   requirements.
 * - `T76_IC_USB_INTERFACE_BULK_IN_QUEUE_SIZE`: The size of the USB interface bulk IN queue. This
 *   should be large enough to handle the maximum expected number of bulk IN transfers.
 * - `T76_IC_USB_INTERFACE_BULK_IN_MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE`: The maximum message size for USB interface
 *   bulk IN transfers. This should be large enough to handle the maximum expected
 *   size of bulk IN messages.
